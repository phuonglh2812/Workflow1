The evening breeze was warm, carrying the faint scent of the bougainvillea that lined the mansion's driveway. I stood on the balcony of Chief Kubana's sprawling estate, watching the sun dip behind the Lagos skyline. My reflection in the glass door caught my eye, barefoot, draped in a silk gown that felt heavier than it looked. To the ward, I was a vision of grace. To me, I was a woman running out of time. Chief had been unusually quiet during dinner. His breathing was laboured and his once booming voice had grown weak, like the flickering flame of a dying candle. I watched him shuffle to his room with the help of his nurse. His fealty was my opportunity, but guilt still lingered like a shadow I couldn't escape. Madam, a soft voice called behind me. It was Emika, his only son. His resemblance to his father was uncanny, but unlike Chief, Emika had a quiet gentleness that drew me in. Didn't know you were still awake, I said, forcing a smile. I couldn't sleep, he replied, stepping closer. You looked lost in thought. I turned back to the skyline, avoiding his eyes. If he knew the thought swirling in my head, he wouldn't be so kind. You care for him, don't you? He asked suddenly. His voice held a hint of doubt. Of course, I lied, my voice steady. He's my husband. Emika nodded but didn't look convinced. I don't know how you do it. Staying by his side through all this. I turned to face him, letting my eyes linger on his face for a moment too long. Sometimes, life gives you responsibilities you can't run from, I said softly. For a second, I saw something flicker in his eyes, curiosity. Admiration. I couldn't tell. But it was enough. Emika was my key to everything and he didn't even know it. I reached out and gently touched his arm. You're a good son, Emika. Your father is lucky to have you. He looked at me, his gaze lingering. And you? What about you, Amora? Are you lucky? I smiled faintly, pulling my hand away. I guess we'll find out. Inside, Chief's cough echoed through the holes, a harsh reminder that the clock was ticking. As I walked back to my room, I felt Emika's eyes follow me and for the first time, I allowed myself to believe I could win this. But in this house, secrets had a way of spilling out when you least expected them. And I had far too many to keep hidden for long. The next morning, the house hummed with its usual controlled chaos. The maids moved like shadows, whispering to one another as they prepared breakfast. Chief remained in his room, his condition worsening by the day. I knew he wouldn't come down today. His nurse had warned me the night before. I sipped my tea in the expansive dining room, my eyes scanning the headlines of the day's newspaper. It was all politics and business, topics that once excited me but now felt so far away from my current reality. Emika walked in, dressed casually in a crisp polo shirt and jeans. His presence filled the room, but his steps were hesitant, like someone carrying an unspoken burden. Good morning, he greeted, his voice soft but deep. Morning, I replied, folding the paper and setting it aside. Did you sleep better? He nodded, though the faint shadows under his eyes told a different story. I needed some fresh air, so I went for a drive earlier. Cleared my head. Hmm, sounds like a good idea, I said, my tone casual, though my mind was already racing. I needed to find a way to draw him closer, to make him trust me. He sat across from me, picking up a slice of toast but barely eating it. Amora, can I ask you something? My heart skipped a bit, but I kept my face calm. Of course. What's on your mind? Why did you marry my father? His question hung in the air, sharp yet curious. I let out a soft laugh, pretending to be cut off guard. Isn't that the question everyone wants to ask? I'm serious, he said, leaning forward slightly. He's a good man, but you're, well, you're young, beautiful, and full of life. It doesn't add up. I tilted my head, pretending to consider my answer carefully. I married him because he offered me stability. He gave me something I didn't know I needed, safety. And he reminded me that love isn't always about fireworks. Sometimes, it's about quiet companionship. Emika studied me for a moment, his eyes searching mine. But are you happy? Are you? I countered, my voice soft but steady. He didn't answer, but his silence spoke volumes. Before the conversation could go any deeper, the nurse appeared in the doorway. Madam, chief is asking for you. I stood, smoothing down my dress. Excuse me, I said to Emika, giving him a small smile before leaving the room. As I walked toward chief's room, my mind replayed the conversation. Emika was asking questions, but he was also listening. That was good. It meant I was getting to him. Chief was propped up in bed when I entered, his skin pale and his breathing labored. His eyes lit up when he saw me, though the spark was faint. How are you feeling this morning? I asked, sitting by his bedside and placing a hand over his. Oh, he said with a weak chuckle. You're still the strongest man I know, I said, my voice warm. He smiled faintly, then gestured to the bedside drawer. There's something I need to show you. I opened the drawer and pulled out a small leather-bound journal. Chief motioned for me to hand it to him, and he flipped through the pages with trembling fingers. This, he said, pointing to a page covered in his neat handwriting, is the will I drew up last month. I've left everything in equal parts to you and Emika. I want you both to have a future, no matter what happens to me. My chest tightened, but I kept my expression neutral. That's very thoughtful of you, I said. Chief nodded, closing the journal and handing it back to me. Keep this safe for me, Amora. I trust you. I took the journal, my fingers brushing against its warm cover. Of course, I said softly. As I left his room, the weight of the journal in my hand felt heavier than it should have. The plan was working, but now I had something I hadn't accounted for, guilt. Back in my room, I locked the door and placed the journal on the dresser. I stared at it for a long time, my mind torn between loyalty and ambition. A soft knock on the door broke my thoughts. Amora, it's me, Emika's voice called. I hesitated before opening the door, finding him standing there with an unreadable expression. Can we talk, he asked, stepping inside without waiting for an answer. What's on your mind? I asked, closing the door behind him. He turned to face me, his jaw tight. I think there's something you're not telling me. About you. About my father. About why you're here. My pause quickened, but I smiled calmly. Emika, you're imagining things. I'm here because I care about your father. That's all. His gaze didn't waver. I don't believe you. For the first time, I felt a crack in my composure. Emika was getting too close to the truth, and I had to figure out a way to steer him away without losing the trust I'd worked so hard to build. I took a slow breath, my mind racing as I studied Emika. He was sharp, sharper than I had anticipated. His piercing gaze held a mix of curiosity and suspicion, and I knew one wrong word could unravel everything I had built. Emika, I began, my voice soft, almost pleading. I understand why you're questioning me. Your father is your word, and you want to protect him. I admire that. He crossed his arms, waiting for me to continue. But you have to understand, I said, taking a step closer, I didn't marry Chief for his worth, as everyone assumes. I married him because he gave me a chance to rebuild my life. When I met him, I was at my lowest. He saw something in me that I couldn't see in myself. And for that, I will always be grateful. Emika's expression softened slightly, but the doubt lingered. I'm not here to hurt anyone, I added, my voice trembling just enough to sound sincere. All I want is to honor the man who gave me a second chance. If you can't trust me, at least trust your father's judgment. He wouldn't have brought me into his life if he didn't believe in me. For a moment, the room was silent, safe for the distant harm of the air conditioner. Emika looked away, running a hand through his hair. I want to believe you, he admitted. But there is so much at stake. If anything happens to my father, this family could fall apart. I reached out and gently touched his arm. Then let's make sure that doesn't happen. Together. His eyes met mine, and I saw the conflict in them, his desire to protect his father clashing with the green bond between us. Okay, he said finally. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. For now. Relief washed over me, but I knew this wasn't over. Emika's trust was fragile, and one misstep could destroy everything. The days turned into weeks, and Chief's health continued to decline. Emika and I grew closer, our conversations deepening as we spent more time together. He began to see me not as an outsider, but as someone who genuinely cared for his father, and, perhaps, for him too. But beneath the surface, the whispers about the wheel grew louder. Extended family members, business associates, and even the staff speculated about what would happen when Chief passed. The tension in the house was palpable, and I knew it was only a matter of time before everything came to light. One evening, as the sun set over the estate, Chief called for me and Emika. We stood by his bedside, the weight of the moment pressing down on us. I don't have much time left, Chief said, his voice barely audible. But before I go, I want to remind you both of something. We leaned in, handing on his every word. Family is all we have, he continued. Money comes and goes, but the people who stand by you in your darkest moments, that's what matters. Don't let greed destroy what I've spent my life building. His words hung in the air long after he had fallen asleep. Emika and I exchanged a glance, the weight of his advice sinking in. Two weeks later, Chief passed away peacefully in his sleep. The house was filled with mourners, each with their own agenda. The reading of the will was a tense affair, but as Chief had promised, everything was divided equally between me and Emika. It wasn't the outcome the others had hoped for, and the whispers of betrayal and manipulation didn't take long to start. But Emika stood by me, his belief in my sincerity stronger than ever. As I sat on the balcony one evening, watching the city lights twinkle in the distance, Emika joined me. You could have taken everything, he said quietly. Why didn't you? I smiled faintly, my heart heavy with the choices I had made. Because your father was right, I said. Family is all we have. And I couldn't destroy that, not for all the money in the world. Emika nodded, his gaze thoughtful. You've changed, Amora. I can see it. Maybe, I said, my voice soft. Or maybe I just finally found what really matters. Advice for women. Life will test you with choices that seem simple but carry heavy consequences. Always remember, integrity is priceless and relationships built on trust and sincerity will outlast any fleeting riches. Choose wisely and let your actions speak louder than the whispers around you.
