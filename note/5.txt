If anyone had told me I'd lose myself this way, I would have laughed it off like a bad Nollywood script. But here I am, sitting in my car, staring at the soft waves of the Leki Lagoon, wondering how my life got distangled. My name is Ashley, and this is not the story I thought I'd be telling. When I married into the Odebanjo family, it felt like stepping into a fairy tale. I was the small-time girl who found love in the arms of Delhi Odebanjo, the handsome and reserved patriarch of one of Nigeria's wealthiest families. His charms swept me off my feet, and his promises made me dream of a life I never thought I deserved. But life has a way of mixing sweetness with salt. The Odebanjo family wasn't just wealthy, they were powerful, with their real estate empire stretching from Banana Island to Abuja. It was clear from the start that the empire wasn't just a business, it was a legacy, and the heart of their legacy was Tanji, my stepson. Tanji was nothing like his father. Where Delhi was calm and methodical, Tanji was vibrant and fiery, with a confidence that could light up any room. He was younger, sharp, and had an eye for innovation. From the moment I met him, there was a tension I couldn't quite place. Was it admiration? Was it intimidation? I couldn't tell. When Delhi assigned Tanji and me to lead the Lecky Heights project together, I thought it was his way of drawing the family closer. We spent long hours poring over architectural designs, negotiating contracts, and visiting the site. Somewhere between late night brainstorming sessions and early morning coffee runs, the lines began to blur. It started innocently, a shared laugh, a hand brushing mine as we reached for the same fire, his gaze lingering a little too long. I told myself it was nothing. After all, Tanji was my stepson. He called me Ashley, not mom, but still, the boundaries were clear. Or so I thought. One evening, after a particularly heated discussion with a contractor, we found ourselves alone in the site office. The rain outside poured heavily, drumming on the roof like a warning. I stood by the window, watching the storm, when I felt him behind me. You're amazing, Ashley, he said softly. His voice was different, lower, deeper. I turned to face him, my heart racing. Tanji, what are you saying? I whispered, even though I knew. I see you, he said, is I searching mine. You're more than just my father's wife. You're. I wanted to stop him. I wanted to walk away. But the truth. A part of me wanted to stay, to hear what he wasn't saying. That night was the beginning of something I couldn't name, something that would change everything. Now, sitting in my car and staring at the lagoon, I wonder, when did I stop being Delhi's wife and start being this? I didn't mean for this to happen. I didn't plan to fall into the arms of the one person I should have avoided. But life is messy and feelings don't come with instructions. As the wind sweeps through the palms lining the water, I know one thing for sure, this secret won't stay hidden for long. And when it comes out, it will shatter the world we've carefully built. The morning after that stormy night in Leki, I woke up to the sound of my phone buzzing relentlessly on the bedside table. It was Delhi. My husband. The man who had given me a life of comfort. The man who trusted me implicitly. Ashley, good morning. His deep voice greeted me when I picked up. I need you and Tanji to come to the house this afternoon. There's something important I want to discuss with both of you. I swallowed hard. Delhi wasn't a man of many words, but when he called you like that, it meant something serious. My heart sank as I glanced over at the pile of papers from last night's work session with Tanji. The lines between us were now so blurred that even sitting across a table from him felt dangerous. Okay, I'll be there, I managed to say, my voice steady, though my hands trembled slightly. Tanji and I didn't speak much that morning. When I saw him at the sight, he gave me a knowing glance, a look that sent shivers down my spine. He was bored, too bored for my fragile resolve. By the time we arrived at the Odebanjo mansion later that day, my nerves were frayed. The house was as grand as ever, with its sprawling marble floors and towering chandeliers, but today, it felt stifling. Delhi sat in his usual spot in the living room, dressed in a crisp white-up border that made him look every bit the powerful man he was. His calm demeanor was a stark contrast to the storm raging inside me. I've been thinking a lot about the future, Delhi began, his eyes moving between Tanji and me. This family's legacy is everything to me. And with the Leki Heights project, I see an opportunity to secure it for the next generation. I nodded, forcing a smile. Tanji, sitting to my right, leaned back in his chair, his confidence unshaken. Delhi continued, Tanji, you've proven yourself to be capable, driven, and visionary. Ashley, your support and contributions have been invaluable. Together, you've made progress on this project that even I didn't anticipate. I felt Tanji's gaze on me, but I didn't dare look at him. Not here. Not now. So, Delhi said, his voice firm, I've decided to formally name you both as colleagues of the Odebanju group. Tanji, you will oversee operations, while Ashley will handle client relations and development strategy. The announcement hit me like a thunder clap. Colleeds. That meant more late nights, more meetings, more everything. Delhi's smile widened. I trust the two of you completely. I know you'll make this family proud. The weight of his words settled heavily on my shoulders. Trust. That word felt like a blade, sharp and unforgiving. As the evening wore on, Delhi excused himself to take a call, leaving Tanji and me alone in the expansive living room. So, colleagues, Tanji said, his voice laced with amusement. Looks like we'll be seeing a lot more of each other. I shot him a warning glance. Tanji, we need to stop this. Stop what? Ashley, he asked, leaning forward, his voice low and teasing. Pretending. Denying what we both feel. Tanji, please, I whispered, my voice barely audible. This can't happen. It shouldn't have happened in the first place. He said, leaning back against the plush sofa. You can lie to yourself all you want, but you can't lie to me. I see it in your eyes every time you look at me. I stood abruptly, the tension in the room suffocating. This is wrong, Tanji. We are playing with fire. And yet, he said, standing to meet me, you keep coming closer to the flame. Before I could respond, Delhi walked back into the room, his face glowing from whatever good news his call had brought. I have to travel to Abuja tomorrow, he announced. I'll be gone for a week. Ashley, make sure everything stays on track with the project while I'm away. I nodded, my mind racing. A week without Delhi meant more time alone with Tanji, more opportunities for mistakes. As I left the mansion that evening, my thoughts were a whirlwind. How did I end up here, torn between loyalty and desire between my husband and his son? The days that followed were a blur. Tanji's presence was like a magnet, pulling me in despite my every attempt to resist. We walked late into the night, our conversation slipping from professional to personal, from guarded to vulnerable. One evening, as we stood on the rooftop of the Leki Heights site, watching the city lights shimmer like stars, he turned to me. Tell me the truth, Ashley, he said. Do you feel it? This thing between us. I looked away, my chest tightening. It doesn't matter how I feel, Tanji. What matters is that this can never happen. But it already has, he said, his voice soft but firm. I'm pretending otherwise won't change that. I had no response. I wanted to deny it, to push him away, but the truth was that he wasn't wrong. As the night deepened, I found myself standing at a crossroads, torn between the life I had built with Delhi and the dangerous pool of something I couldn't name. And deep down, I knew that the choices I made in the days to come would change everything, for me, for Tanji, and for the other Banjo family. A week without Delhi turned into the longer seven days of my life. Each day was a battle against myself, against my growing feelings for Tanji, and against the knowing guilt that kept me awake at night. The more time I spent with Tanji, the harder it became to draw the line. It wasn't just the stolen glances or the way he said my name, it was the conversations, the laughter, and the way he seemed to understand me in ways Delhi never could. But deep down, I knew we were walking a dangerous path, one that could only lead to destruction. The breaking point came on a Friday night. We had just wrapped up a meeting with investors, and the team had gone home. Tanji and I stayed back to finalize some details. As I gathered my things to leave, he stepped in front of me, blocking my way. Ashley, he said, his voice low and urgent. Tanji, don't, I said, shaking my head. But he didn't move. You can't keep running from this. From us. There is no us, Tanji, I snapped, my voice breaking. Whatever this is, it has to end. It should never have started. He stared at me, his jaw tight. So that's it. You're just going to pretend like none of this happened. Like you don't feel what I feel. I looked at him, my heart aching. I can't do this to Delhi. He's a good man. He doesn't deserve this. And what about you, Ashley, he asked, his voice softening. What do you deserve? I didn't have an answer. That night, as I drove home, tears blurred my vision. I knew I had to make a choice. Not just for Delhi or for Tanji, but for myself. When Delhi returned from Abuja, I sat him down and told him everything. Not about Tanji, some secrets are too heavy to share, but about how I felt lost, disconnected, and unsure of who I was anymore. He listened quietly, his face unreadable. When I finished, he took my hand in his. Ashley, marriage isn't perfect. It's messy, and it's hard, but it's also about commitment. If you're willing to fight for us, so am I. His words hit me like a wave. For the first time in a long time, I felt seen, not as the glamorous wife of a wealthy man, but as Ashley, a woman trying to find her way. From that day on, I made a decision. I pulled back from the project, handing over my responsibilities to a capable colleague. I focused on rebuilding my marriage, on finding myself again. As for Tanji, we kept our distance. The fire between us had burned bright, but it was a fire that could only destroy. I knew I couldn't undo the past, but I could choose not to let it define my future. Advice for women. To every woman reading this, remember this, life will test you, and emotions can cloud your judgement. But in the end, you are responsible for the choices you make. Never lose yourself in someone else's shadow, and never let temporary feelings lead you to permanent mistakes. Love yourself enough to walk away from situations that threaten your peace, your values, and your integrity. And most importantly, remember that true strength isn't in perfection. It's in owning your flaws, learning from them, and choosing to do better.
