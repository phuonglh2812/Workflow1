The first time it happened, it was like a mistake wrapped in a dream. I didn't plan for anything like this, God knows I didn't. I was Amina, the face that Greased Magazine covers for decades, not married to the man every girl in Lagos called a dream husband. But somehow, my life was beginning to feel like a perfectly decorated cage. It was supposed to be just work. My husband, Mr. Bello, was busy expanding his empire and I was there to breathe life into the new fashion line. That's where Cyril came in. His creativity was sharp, his eyes sharper. I had always seen him as my stepson, even though he rarely called me mommy. He called me Amina like we were partners, like equals. One late evening at the studio, the lights dimmed, the city noise melting into soft whispers outside, Cyril showed me his designs. Amina, he said, his voice low, almost trembling, these pieces, they are inspired by you. I laughed, brushing it off, but when I looked closer, I saw it. Every curve, every detail in the fabric, it was me. My essence. My past. My pain. And when his hand brushed mine, lingering just a second too long, something broke inside me. Or maybe something woke up. I should have stepped away. I should have stopped it before it started. But you know how life can be, eh? Small, small, the lines began to blur. First, it was just glances across the room. Then it became late night conversations about dreams, art, and regrets. The first kiss came like a thief in the night. It stole my breath, my reasoning, my peace. Every time I looked at Cyril after that, I asked myself, Amina, what in you they do? But the heart doesn't listen to common sense, ABI. And before I knew it, we were deep in something I didn't know how to escape. The days that followed felt like I was walking on hot coals, careful not to let my feet linger too long, but unable to stop moving forward. Cyril and I became experts at hiding in plain sight. We spoke in court, exchanged knowing looks during family dinners, and passed notes like two teenagers caught in a dangerous game. Mr. Bello had no idea. His mind was always on the next deal, the next acquisition. And why would he suspect anything? I was his wife, the woman he trusted to hold the family together. But guilt is a funny thing. It doesn't knock on your door, it seeps in, like rain through a leaky roof. One Sunday afternoon, as the sun burned high over Lagos, I sat in the garden with my sketchpad. I hadn't drawn in years, but something about Cyril made me want to create again. I was sketching a gown, long and flowing, with intricate beadwork around the neckline when Mr. Bello walked in. He stood behind me, his shadow looming over my walk. Is this for the new collection, he asked, his tone casual. Yes, I replied, forcing a smile. My hands trembled as I held the pencil. It's beautiful, he said, leaning down to kiss my cheek. His lips felt warm, familiar, but in that moment, they also felt foreign. Later that night, Cyril texted me. Studio, 11 p.m. I should have ignored it. I should have stayed in bed with my husband. But at 10.45 p.m., I found myself sleeping out of the house, heart racing like a drum. The studio was dark, except for the faint blow of a desk lamp. Cyril was there, bent over a sewing machine, stitching a piece of fabric that shimmered like liquid gold. He didn't look up when I entered. I've been waiting, he said softly. For what? I asked, though I already knew the answer. For you, he replied, finally meeting my eyes. There was something raw in his gaze, something I couldn't run from. Before I could stop myself, I was standing beside him, my fingers tracing the fabric he had been working on. This is beautiful, I whispered. It's for you, he said, his voice barely audible. For a moment, neither of us spoke. The silence wrapped around us like a cocoon, fragile but unbreakable. Then he reached for my hand, his touch sending shivers down my spine. Amina, he said, his voice trembling, do you ever think about what it would be like if things were different? I didn't answer. Instead, I let my head rest on his shoulder, my heart turning against my ribs. I knew this wasn't just about the designs, the studio, or even the quiet nights we stole together. This was about a part of me I thought I had buried long ago, a part Sarah had somehow on earth. But the more time I spent with him, the more I felt the walls closing in. How long could we keep this up before someone noticed? Before Mr. Bello noticed. The questions haunted me as I left the studio that night, sleeping back into bed beside my husband. His breathing was steady, peaceful. I stared at the ceiling, my mind racing. This wasn't just a secret anymore. It was a ticking time bomb. The unraveling began on a day that looked just like every other. The Lagos sun was high, and the house buzzed with preparations for Mr. Bello's Gala, a night to showcase the new collection Sarah and I had worked so closely on. The tension in the air felt electric. As I stood in front of the mirror, adjusting my gold dress, I caught my reflection. My face, still striking but tired, stared back at me. The woman who had Grace magazine covers, who had married the man every woman envied, nor carried a secret too heavy for her to bear. The gala was packed, the room alive with laughter and clinking glasses. Mr. Bello was the perfect host, shaking hands and introducing me as the creative force behind the collection. Sarah moved through the crowd like a star in his own right. His designs had made waves, and tonight was his moment. But as the night wore on, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Mr. Bello's smiles lingered too long. His eyes darted between Sarah and me, sharp and calculating. Then it happened. During the toast, Mr. Bello raised his glass and said, to my wife, Amina, and my son Sarah. Their partnership is the heart of this collection, and their bond, he paused, his voice dripping with something I couldn't quite place. Their bond inspires us all. The room erupted in applause, but my heart dropped. His words weren't a compliment, they were a warning. Later that night, in the quiet of our bedroom, Mr. Bello confronted me. He didn't yell. He didn't accuse. He simply looked at me and said, do you think I don't see? The late nights. The stolen glances. I build this empire on observation, Amina. Don't insult me by pretending I'm blind. My throat tightened. It's not what you think, I whispered, but even I didn't believe my words. End it, he said firmly. End it now, or I will. The weight of his words crushed me. That night, I lay awake, torn between two words. One where I stayed, pretending this betrayal never happened, and another where I chased the freedom Sarah represented. In the end, the choice wasn't mine. The next morning, Sarah left for Paris. Mr. Bello had arranged everything, a sudden opportunity for him to oversee the expansion of the brand in Europe. Sarah's departure was swift, without a proper goodbye. I stood at the window, watching the car that took him away. My heart ached, but deep down, I knew this was for the best. Life moved on, as it always does. The whispers in the house quieted, and the tension between Mr. Bello and me slowly eased. But the guilt lingered, a shadow that followed me everywhere. Advice for women. As I sit here now, years later, I think about the choices I made. To every woman reading this, I'll say this. Guard your heart and your home. Temptation will come, dressed in beauty and wrapped in emotion. It will seem like the answer to the emptiness you feel. But the cost is always greater than you imagine. Love and passion are powerful, but so is commitment. Don't let fleeting moments destroy what you've built. And if you find yourself yearning for something outside your marriage, take a step back and ask yourself, what am I truly missing? Sometimes, what you're looking for is something only you can give yourself.
