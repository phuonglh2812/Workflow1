They say every woman has her own story but mine. Mine is one day a whisper about long after the lights go out. When Wike first looked at me, I knew I had him. Not just because of his money, though that was the icing, but because he needed me to fill the silence in his mansion. The air in his house was heavy, almost suffocating. His late wife had left behind memories in every corner, and his son, Ubi, barely spoke more than two words to him. I walked into that house determined. Not just for me, for my family back in the village, the ones who called me every week asking for help I couldn't give. Wike wasn't just a husband, he was my way out. My chance to rewrite my story. But Ubi, or Ubi, he was the wild card. Sharp, confident, and with a little bit of that arrogance rich boys wear like cologne. I didn't plan for him. Honestly, I didn't. But sometimes, fit sets a table you can't resist dining at. The first time I met him, he sized me up like I was just another of his father's mistakes. But I could see the crack in his armor, the pressure to succeed, to prove himself. A small seed of doubt, and I watered it. Ubi, I'd say, brushing past him in the corridor, your father's lucky to have you. I don't know what he'd do without you. Flattery works, especially when it's wrapped in just enough truth to feel real. I didn't push too hard. That's the trick. You let them come to you. And he did. First, it was innocent. He'd talk about his startup, how his father never understood him. Then, slowly, I let the walls come down, my walls. Told him stories of my struggles, how I knew what it felt like to be underestimated. We became allies. Or so he thought. I could see the guilt in his eyes the night everything changed. It was in the way he avoided looking at me afterward, like I was a mirror he didn't want to face. But I didn't feel guilt. Only determination. Wike trusted Ubi with everything, passwords, accounts, plans. All I had to do was guide Ubi, gently, like a river carving its path through rock. He didn't even realize when I became his compass. But Wike. Wike wasn't as blind as I thought. Lately, he's been watching me. Not with love, but with questions. He hasn't said anything outright, but I can feel it in the way his hand lingers on his chin when he sees me on the phone. Or how he pauses at the doorway just long enough to overhear. I should be scared, but I'm not. Not yet. Because this story. It's far from over. The air in the mansion had shifted. It was subtle, like the way Hamatan sneaks in at night, leaving everything dry and cracked by morning. Wike didn't say much these days, but his silence felt louder than ever. I tried to stay calm, act like everything was normal. Breakfast was still served on time, his tea brewed just the way he liked it. But his eyes, those piercing eyes, followed me everywhere. It was like he was waiting for me to sleep. Gloria, he said one evening as we sat in the living room. His tone was casual, but his eyes were sharp. You've been quiet these days. Everything okay. I forced a smile, the kind that always melted his suspicions before. Of course, dear. Just thinking about your birthday next month. I want to make it special. He chuckled, but it didn't reach his eyes. You've already made my life special, Gloria. My heart skipped, but not out of love. Was that a compliment or a warning? Obi walked in at that moment, his laptop tucked under his arm. His usual confidence seemed dimmed lately. I knew why he was beginning to feel the weight of what we'd done. Dad, Obi said, sitting across from him. We need to talk about the Lagos project. There are some changes I think we should consider. Wike nodded, his focus shifting. I used the opportunity to sleep away. I needed to think to regroup. In my room, I pissed. Wike was getting too close to something. I could feel it. And Obi, he was starting to falter. I couldn't afford to let him back out now, not when we were so close. Later that night, I found Obi in his home office, staring at his laptop screen like it held the answers to his life. Obi, I said softly, closing the door behind me. He looked up, startled. What are you doing here? I came to check on you, I said, sitting on the edge of his desk. You've been distant. He sighed, running a hand through his hair. This, this is all too much, Gloria. I don't think we should continue. Panic fled, but I kept my voice steady. Obi, listen to me. We've come too far to stop now. Do you want all our efforts to be for nothing? All your plans, your dreams, this is how we make them happen. He shook his head. It's wrong. Dad doesn't deserve this. Doesn't deserve what? We both froze. The voice came from the doorway. Wike stood there, his face unreadable. I felt the room spin, but I quickly composed myself. Wike, you startled us. Obi and I were just discussing some challenges with his business. Wike stepped inside, his gaze bouncing between us. Is that so? Then why does Obi look like he's seen a ghost? Obi opened his mouth, but no words came out. I had to think fast. It's nothing serious, dear. Just some stress. You know how these young people are with their startups. Wike didn't respond. He just stared at Obi, waiting for him to speak. The tension in the room was unbearable. I could see the crack widening between father and son. And in that moment, I knew this wasn't just about money anymore. It was about control. And Wike wasn't going to let go without a fight. Wike's piercing gaze lingered on Obi, then shifted to me. My heart pounded, but I stood my ground, forcing a Komsmeyer. Obi, Wike said finally, his voice low but steady, if there's something you need to tell me, now is the time. Obi glanced at me, his eyes filled with conflict. I could see his mind racing, turn between loyalty to his father and the web of deceit we'd spawned together. For a moment, I thought he'd crack. But he didn't. Dad, Obi said, his voice trembling, it's nothing. Just some work stress, like Gloria said. Wike's expression didn't change. He simply nodded, turned, and walked out of the room without another word. The sound of his footsteps echoed down the hallway, leaving an uneasy silence in their wake. Obi let out a shaky breath. I can't do this anymore, Gloria. I'm out. Obi. No, he caught me off, standing up. This was a mistake. I'll find another way to build my business. I'm done lying to him. I stared at him, my mind scrambling for a way to pull him back, but something in his eyes had changed. He was no longer the ambitious young man I could manipulate. He was his father's son, stronger than I'd given him credit for. The next morning, Wike called me into his study. He was seated behind his massive mahogany desk, a glass of water in front of him. Gloria, he began, his tone come but firm. I've been patient, but I can't ignore what's been happening in this house. I may not know the full story yet, but I know when someone is playing games. My throat went dry. Wike, I don't understand. He held up a hand, silencing me. I trusted you, Gloria. I brought you into my life, into my family. But trust is fragile, and once it's broken, he didn't finish the sentence. He didn't need to. I wanted to defend myself, to lie, to twist the story in my favor. But something in his voice, something in his eyes, told me it was over. Later that day, I packed my bags. Wike didn't say another word to me, and Ubi avoided me altogether. As I stepped out of the mansion for the last time, I felt the weight of my choices pressing down on me. Advice for women. As I walked away, I thought about the life I'd tried to build, the shortcuts I'd taken, and the trust I'd shattered. My advice to every woman out there is this, don't lose yourself chasing wealth or comfort. A foundation built on lies we always crumble. Build your life with honesty, strength, and dignity. That way, no matter where you stand, you'll stand tall. This isn't the end of my story. But it's the beginning of a lesson I'll never forget. Mr. The end of my story. Thank you
