Chaik and I hadn't even been married for a year, yet loneliness already felt like my closest friend. He was always traveling, business trips here and there. At first, I thought I could handle it. After all, isn't that what I signed up for when I married a wealthy man like him. But the big house we shared was too quiet, too empty, especially at night. Then there was Chidi, my stepson. He was nothing like his father. Where Chaik was calm and composed, Chidi was loud, restless and stubborn. He had just dropped out of university and honestly, I didn't know what to make of him at first. He was always around the house, playing music too loud, walking around with his shirt unbuttoned like he owned the world. At first, we barely spoke. But one evening, during one of Chaik's long trips, I found Chidi sitting in the kitchen, eating bread straight from the loaf. He laughed when I scolded him, saying I sounded like his late mother. That made me pause. I could see something in his eyes, maybe sadness, maybe anger. I didn't know. But it pulled me in. We started talking more after that night. About small things at first, music, movies, food. Then bigger things, his struggles, my loneliness. One night, during a power outage, we sat outside, the moonlight soft on his face. He reached for my hand and I didn't pull away. I should have. But I didn't. What started as innocent moments turned into something else. Something I can't explain. It wasn't planned. It wasn't right. But it happened. And for a while, it felt like our secret world where everything made sense. But secrets have a way of slipping through cracks. One afternoon, a security guard from the estate came to the house. He looked uneasy, fidgeting with his cap. Then he dropped a bombshell, CCTV footage. My heart stopped. He had seen everything. Every kiss, every touch. He wanted money to keep quiet. A lot of money. Chidi and I panicked. How would we get that kind of money without check noticing? And even if we paid, could we trust this man to keep his mouth shut? While we were trying to figure it out, Chidi came back from one of his trips, earlier than expected. He seemed different. Quiet. Watchful. And then something strange happened. Chidi found an envelope in Chidi's study. Inside were photos of Chidi with a woman who wasn't me. A woman I recognized from somewhere, but I couldn't place her. As we tried to piece it all together, I began to wonder, was Chik hiding something too? Was his constant traveling really about work? And if he had secrets of his own, could they somehow help us bury ours? The walls were closing in, and I didn't know how much longer I could hold everything together. The more I thought about those photos Chidi found, the more uneasy I became. The woman looked familiar, but I couldn't figure out why. My mind kept running in circles. Was she his mistress? A business associate. Someone from his past. And why was Chik hiding her pictures in his study, locked away like some kind of forbidden treasure? Meanwhile, Chidi and I were walking on eggshells around the house. The estate guard's threat still hum over us like a dark cloud. Every knock on the door, every ring of my phone made my heart jump. Chidi wanted to confront him, he kept saying he'd find a way to handle it. But I begged him to leave it alone. What if the guard exposed us to Chik? Or worse, to the entire estate? One night, Chidi stormed into my room, his face tight with anger. Momming more, he started, his voice shaking. He always called me that when he was trying to sound serious. We can't keep waiting. That man can't be trusted. He'll just keep asking for more money. We need to act. I sighed, trying to keep calm. And do what? Chidi. You think you can scare him? What if he goes to your father? What then? Chidi's face softened for a moment, then he muttered, there's something off about that. I can feel it. What are you talking about? I asked, my stomach tightening. I saw him last night, Chidi said, lowering his voice. He was on a phone call in the study. He didn't see me, but I heard him. He sounded angry, like he was threatening someone. He kept saying, if you don't leave Lagos by next week, you'll regret it. I think it has something to do with that woman in the pictures. My mind raced. Chik was always the calm one, the composed one. I couldn't imagine him making threats, but Chidi sounded so sure. And if Chik had secrets of his own, maybe we could use them to protect ours. The next morning, I decided to investigate. While Chik was out, I searched his study. I was careful, making sure to put everything back exactly as I found it. But I didn't find much, just more envelopes with photos, receipts from random hotels, and a handwritten note with the name Amora on it. Amora. The name struck a chord, but I still couldn't place it. Later that day, I was sitting in the living room when Chik walked in, his suitcase in hand. He said he was leaving for Abuja that evening, another business trip. But as he kissed my Chik goodbye, I felt his gaze linger on me, as if he knew something. The moment he left, I called Chidi into the kitchen. We need to figure out who this Amora is, I told him. If your father is hiding something, we can't just sit and wait. We need answers. Chidi nodded, his eyes sharp. Leave it to me. For the next few days, Chidi dug into Chik's life. He followed the trail of hotel receipts, made calls pretending to be someone else, even bribed one of Chik's business associates. Slowly, a picture began to form, a picture that left me shaken. Amora wasn't just anyone. She was Chik's ex-fianc√©. The woman he was supposed to marry years ago, before she disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Nobody knew what happened to her, and Chik never talked about it. But now, it seemed she was back, and Chik wasn't happy about it. As Chidi and I pieced things together, something became clear, Chik wasn't just hiding Amora. He was trying to keep her quiet. And the more we uncovered, the more I started to wonder if Chik was capable of things I didn't even want to imagine. But before we could dig deeper, the estate guard came back. This time, he wasn't alone. He had brought a man with him, someone who looked like he meant business. N'ma, the guard said, his voice calm but firm. Time is running out. Pay up, or I'll make sure everyone knows what you and your stepson have been up to. I felt my knees weakened, but Chidi stepped forward, his jaw tight. Do what you want, Chidi said, his voice steady. But if you cross us, you won't like how this ends. The guard smacked, but I could tell he wasn't expecting Chidi to stand up to him. Still, I knew this wasn't over. As the door closed behind them, I turned to Chidi. What have you done? But before he could answer, my phone burst. It was a text from an unknown number. I know what you've been hiding, N'ma. And I know what Chidi has been hiding too. Meet me at the old cafe tomorrow at 10am. Come alone. I stared at the message, my heart pounding. Who could this be? And how much did they know? The message from the unknown number haunted me all night. I couldn't sleep. My mind was filled with questions, who sent it? Was it the estate guard or someone else entirely? And how much did they really know? The next morning, I told Chidi about the text. He was furious, insisting on coming with me to the cafe, but I refused. This is my mess, I said. I have to face it alone. Reluctantly, he agreed but made me promise to keep my phone on and call him if anything went wrong. At exactly 10am, I arrived at the old cafe. It was almost empty, just a few people scattered around. I sat by the window, my hands trembling as I clutched my bag. Minutes felt like hours, but finally, a woman walked in. She was tall, graceful, unfamiliar, too familiar. My heart stopped when I realized who she was. Amora, I whispered. She smiled faintly and sat across from me. Nmo, she said, her voice calm but firm. You've been busy, haven't you? I didn't know what to say. My mouth felt dry. I'm not here to judge you, she continued. But I need you to know something, Chak isn't the man you think he is. What do you mean? I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. She leaned in, her eyes locking onto mine. Years ago, Chak and I were engaged. Everything seemed perfect until I found out the truth about his business. It's not just oil and gas, nmo. Chak has ties to dangerous people, people who would do anything to protect him. When I tried to leave, he made sure I disappeared. I only survived because someone helped me escape. I felt the blood drain from my face. Could this really be true? Was the man I married capable of such darkness? Amora reached into her bag and pulled out a folder. This has everything you need to know. Bank statements, emails, photos. Use it to protect yourself, nmo. And protect Chidi too. Chak won't forgive betrayal, not from you, not from anyone. Tears welled up in my eyes. Why are you helping me? Because I've been where you are, she said, standing up. And no one helped me when I needed it. Don't make the same mistake I did. Before I could say another word, she walked out of the cafe, leaving me alone with the folder. Back at the house, I shared everything with Chidi. He was stunned but determined. We knew we had to act fast. Using the evidence Amora gave us, we filed a report anonymously with the authorities. It wasn't easy, Chak had powerful connections, but we hoped it would at least put him under scrutiny. As for the estate guard, we managed to pay him off using money Chak kept hidden in the house. It was risky, but it bought her some time. Then, one evening, Chak came home earlier than usual. His face was dark, his movements sharp. He didn't say much, but I could tell he suspected something. Nmo, he said quietly, is there something you want to tell me? I froze, my heart pounding. But before I could answer, Chidi walked into the room, come and composed. Dad, we need to talk, he said. Weeks later, everything had changed. Chak was under investigation, his business empire crumbling. Chidi and I moved out of the estate, starting fresh in a quiet part of town. It wasn't easy, but it was a chance to rebuild. Looking back, I've learned something important, secret, we always find a way to the surface. And no matter how lonely or desperate you feel, the choices you make in the dark can shape your future forever. To every woman reading this, here's my advice. Never ignore your instincts. Pay attention to the signs around you. And above all, know your worth. Don't let loneliness or fear drive you into decisions that can destroy you.
