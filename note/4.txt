i swear if someone had told me that one day i would fall for my own stepson i would have laughed and called them mad but here i am sitting in front of this camera telling a story even i can't believe when i met johnny my husband everything about him screamed comfort and security he was the kind of man any lagos girl would pray for wealthy respectful and well connected i had worked hard to clean up my past and build my name as linda the go to lagos lifestyle blogger and johnny was like a cherry on top of the perfect life i had created but then fred happened fred johnny's 22 year old son had just come back from the uk when i married his father he was tall soft-spoken and always had this air of confidence that made you want to hear what he had to say i didn't pay him much attention at first to me he was just johnny's boy another reminder of the kind of life i was marrying into that changed the day he knocked on the door of my home office laptop in hand linda i know you're busy but can i ask you for some advice about podcasting he said flashing a smile that could make anyone listen i looked up from my screen surprised podcasting since when did you start doing that since forever but now i want to take it seriously he said pulling up a chair without waiting for me to agree we started talking about content creation from how to find the right audience to dealing with internet trolls he was sharp curious and full of ideas before i knew it hours had passed and we were still chatting like old friends but then one night everything shifted fred badged into the kitchen where i was warming leftovers his phone clutched tightly in his hand linda can i ask you something he said his tone different serious and almost accusing i froze sure what's up is it true he asked holding out his phone on the screen was an old photo of me not the polish linda everyone knows today but the linda from years ago the one with red wigs skimpy outfits and eyes that held secrets no one could decode i felt my throat go dry fred i i wasn't even looking for it he interrupted shaking his head i was researching trending topics for my podcast and then your name came up linda this version of you the comments the gossip it's wild my heart pounded i had buried that life so deeply or so i thought but here it was staring back at me through fred's eyes fred that was a long time ago i started my voice trembling i know he said quietly and it doesn't change how good you are at what you do now but it makes me curious curious about what about you the review the one nobody sees that was the beginning of everything we started spending more time together not just because of his podcast but because i found myself drawn to the way he looked at me not with judgment but with understanding we would sit for hours bouncing ideas off each other laughing about internet drama and sharing stories that felt too personal to say out loud but the more time we spent the more dangerous things became one evening as we reviewed an episode of his podcast in my living room fred looked at me and said something i wasn't ready to hear linda sometimes i feel like you're the only person who really gets me he said his voice low i laughed nervously come on fred you're just saying that because i'm helping with your podcast he shook his head no it's more than that i mean it fred's words hung in the air like the weight of lagos traffic heavy suffocating and impossible to ignore i felt my chest tighten my mind racing for a response that wouldn't sound awkward fred i finally managed forcing a smile you've had a long day i think you're just tired let's continue this tomorrow but he didn't budge instead he leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees his eyes fixed on me in a way that made my stomach flip linda you don't have to pretend he said softly i know there's more going on here between us fred stop i said my voice shaky there's nothing going on i'm your stepmom for god's sake he leaned back running his hand through his hair and let out a frustrated sigh i know but i can't help how i feel i stood up abruptly grabbing the empty cups on the table just to give my hand something to do my heart was racing and i couldn't meet his gaze this conversation ends here i said my voice former than i felt it's late you should go to bed fred didn't argue he just nodded slowly got up and walked to his room but as i had the door closed behind him i realized i wasn't relieved i was confused and scared the days that followed were a mess of emotions i threw myself into my work taking on more collaborations than i could handle just to stay distracted but fred wasn't making it easy he started finding excuses to be around me joining me in the kitchen while i cooked casually bringing his podcast setup into my office because the wi-fi was better there and even offering to help with my blog shoots and honestly i didn't hate it it felt good to have someone who actually listened who saw me for more than just johnny's wife or linda the blogger fred asked questions no one else thought to ask he wanted to know about my childhood my dreams and even my fears questions one night we were both in the garden i was sipping wine trying to enjoy the peace when fred walked out and sat beside me do you ever feel like you're living someone else's life he asked out of nowhere i glanced at him startled what do you mean he shrubbed looking up at the stars like you've built this version of yourself that everyone loves but deep down you don't even know if it's really you my heart skipped a bit how did he manage to put into words what i had been feeling for years maybe i said quietly fred turned to look at me his expression soft you don't have to answer if you don't want to i just feel like you get it i looked away my chest tightening again i wanted to tell him he was wrong that i had it all figured out but i couldn't i think everyone feels that way sometimes i finally said he nodded and for a moment we just sat there in silence the sounds of lagos nightlife humming in the background but of course lagos has no secrets and my carefully curated word was about to be tested days turned into weeks and the tension between fred and me became unbearable i tried to convince myself it was just a passing face something he'd grew out of and something i could ignore but the heart doesn't always listen to reason one night after johnny had gone to bed fred knocked on my office door linda we need to talk he said stepping inside before i could respond i didn't look up for my laptop fred it's late can we do this tomorrow no he said firmly closing the door behind him i can't keep pretending like nothing's happening and neither can you i finally looked at him my heart racing fred what do you want me to say that i feel something that i'm confused because i do but it doesn't matter it can't matter why not he asked his voice breaking we understand each other linda more than you and my dad ever could his words eat me like a slap johnny my husband the man who had taken me from a world of struggle and giving me a life i never thought i deserved how could i even entertain these feelings fred this has to stop i said standing up whatever you think is happening here it ends now he stepped closer his eyes pleading linda you're not happy i see it and i'm not trying to ruin your life but you deserve to be with someone who truly gets you i felt tears welling up fred you don't understand this isn't just about me there's a family here a reputation do you know what would happen if anyone found out fred looked down his shoulders slumping so that's it you'd rather live a lie than take a chance on something real i took a deep breath forcing myself to stay strong fred i love johnny maybe not in the way you think love should be but i owe him my loyalty and you you're just searching for something this isn't love fred it's confusion he looked at me for a long moment his eyes filled with a mix of hurt and understanding finally he nodded you're right i'm sorry with that he turned and walked out leaving me alone in the silence of my office the next morning fred announced he was moving out he told johnny it was because he wanted to focus on his podcast and needed his own space johnny was proud oblivious to the storm brewing beneath the surface as for me i threw myself even harder into my work determined to bury the past few months and never look back but late at night when the world was quiet i couldn't help but wonder had i made the right choice advice for women life will test you in ways you never expect you face choices that challenge your values your heart and your sense of self but no matter how tempting the wrong path may seem always remember who you are and what you stand for your what is not tied to someone else's attention or affection protect your peace your integrity and your future in a world full of distractions staying true to yourself is the ultimate power
