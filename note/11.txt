I stood by the window, my fingers tracing invisible lines on the glass. The lights of leaky phase once sparkled like scattered diamonds, but my heart was heavier than the ocean. Maurice, my husband, was asleep in the master bedroom upstairs, snoring softly, completely unaware of the storm brewing under his own roof. Tossing, I whispered into the air. His name left my lips like a forbidden prayer. When Maurice first brought me to this house, I thought I had walked into a dream. Everything was gold, marble, and endless space. Even the air smelled expensive. I remember the day I moved in, the staff lined up like soldiers to welcome me, but Tossing stood at the back, arms crossed, his eyes burning with quiet rage. Maurice had warned me, Tossing doesn't trust easily, but he'll come around. The patient. At first, I thought Tossing hated me. I mean, who could blame him? A 26-year-old actress marrying his 58-year-old father. It wasn't a Nollywood plot, it was real life, and I was living it. But then, something strange happened. One evening, I found him watching one of my old movies. His laptop screen glowed in the dark, and I could hear my own voice speaking lines I'd memorized years ago. I smiled, standing quietly behind him. I didn't know you were a fan, I teased. He jumped, quickly closing the laptop. I'm not. I was just studying your technique, he muttered. That's how it started. Tossing, the aspiring filmmaker, wanted to learn from me. Maurice was over the moon when he heard I was helping Tossing with his first project. You see, I told you he'd warm up to you, he said, pulling me into a hug. But Maurice didn't see what I saw. He didn't see the way Tossing's eyes lingered just a second too long when we rehearsed lines together. He didn't notice how our hands brushed when we flipped through scripts. And he certainly didn't feel the electric charge in the air every time we were left alone. One night, Tossing showed me a script he'd been working on. It was about a forbidden love that could destroy a family. I read it, my hands trembling slightly. This is powerful, I said, my voice barely above a whisper. It's inspired by real emotions, he replied, his eyes locking onto mine. I knew I should have stepped back. I should have drawn a line. But instead, I leaned closer. What emotions, Tossing? I asked, my voice shaky. He didn't answer, but the silence spoke louder than words. Now, as I stood by the window, the weight of what we'd done hung heavy in the air. Maurice was asleep upstairs, completely trusting. Tossing was in his room, editing footage for a project that might never see the light of day. And me. I was stuck in the middle, torn between guilt and something I couldn't even name. The house was silent, but inside me, there was a storm. Would anyone believe me if I said I didn't plan for this to happen? That I didn't wake up one day and decide to ruin the fragile balance of a family? I didn't know how to untangle myself from this web. Or maybe I didn't want to. The story wasn't over. Far from it. The next morning, the house seemed too quiet. The kind of quiet where even the birds outside seemed to hold their breath, waiting for something to happen. Maurice was in his study, busy with some work, while Tossing had locked himself in his room again, as usual, immersed in his world of filmmaking. But I couldn't focus on anything. I couldn't stop thinking about the night before. Tossing's eyes, the way his breath had hitched when he was near me, the weight of his fingers brushing against mine. My skin still burned from it. It wasn't supposed to be like this. I should've stopped it before it went this far, but here we were. I walked down the hallway to Tossing's room, the sound of my heels kicking louder in my ears than I wanted. My heart raced with a mix of fear and something else I couldn't name. I knocked softly on his door. Come in, he called, his voice hoarse, like he hadn't slept. I pushed the door open slowly, finding him sitting at his desk, surrounded by scattered film reels and his laptop. His face was hidden behind a pile of papers, but the moment I stepped in, he lifted his head and our eyes met. Can we talk? I asked, the words tumbling out before I could stop them. He didn't answer right away. Instead, he just looked at me, his gaze intense, almost as if he were trying to read something hidden in my eyes. Then, finally, he nodded. We need to talk. I stepped inside, closing the door softly behind me. The room was dark, lit only by the cold glow of his laptop screen. I. I've been thinking about what happened last night, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. It was wrong, Tossing. It wasn't supposed to happen. Tossing didn't say anything for a long moment. He just sat there, his eyes never leaving mine. Finally, he spoke, his voice barely above a whisper. You think I don't know that. But you're not the only one who feels something. I can't pretend anymore, Sandra. The words hit me like a punch to the chest. My breath caught in my throat. What do you mean? He stood up and walked towards me, slow and deliberate. His presence filled the room and I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. I'm not blind, he said. I know what this is. You and me. It's not just about the film anymore. It's something else. Something real. I wanted to pull away, to tell him to stop, to remind him of the mess we were both tangled in. But I didn't. I stood there, frozen, as he took another step closer. His hand reached out, gently brushing a strand of hair away from my face, his touch soft yet electric. I couldn't deny it. There was something between us, something that neither of us had planned, but couldn't ignore anymore. The air between us was thick with unspoken words, with things we both knew but weren't ready to admit. You're my father's wife, Tosin said, his voice barely audible. But when I look at you, I don't see his wife. I see something else. Something I shouldn't. I stepped back, my heart racing. Tosin, no. But he was already there, closer now, his eyes burning with intensity. It doesn't matter, Sandra. You're everything I've been looking for. I know it's wrong, but I can't stop it. And I don't want to. The words hung in the air, thick and suffocating. My words spun, my heart cut between the man I had married and the son of the man I had married. I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, trying to find my voice. We have to stop this. We can't do this to Maurice, to your father. It's not right. Tosin laughed softly, a bitter sound. It's too late for that, Sandra. It's already happened. The question now is, what do we do about it? I wanted to scream, to tell him to leave me alone, to remind him of the consequences. But all that came out was a shaky breath. I don't know. He stepped back, his eyes never leaving mine. Then you'll have to choose, Sandra. You'll have to choose between what's right and what feels real. The door to the room opened suddenly, and Maurice stood in the doorway, his face surprised but calm. What's going on in here? He asked, looking between us. I turned away, my heart hammering in my chest, not knowing how to explain the mess we had made. Maurice didn't see it, but he felt it. There was something in the air, something shifting, but he didn't know what. I was just helping Tosin with his script, I said quickly, my voice unsteady. We're fine. Maurice nodded, a smile on his face. Alright, then. Just don't stay in here too long. We're having dinner in an hour. As he left, I exhaled slowly, my hands trembling. Tosin's gaze lingered on me for a moment before he turned away. It wasn't over. Not by a long shot. The night grew darker, but I couldn't sleep. The weight of what had happened pressed down on me like a heavy stone, and I couldn't push it away. I lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling, my mind racing. Maurice was sleeping soundly beside me, unaware of the turmoil I was drowning in. His steady breathing only reminded me of the lie I was living. The following day, everything seemed to return to normal, or at least, it looked that way on the surface. Tosin and I barely exchanged words, but the tension was thick. I could feel him watching me from across the room, his eyes lingering just a little too long, and it made my skin crawl. But I couldn't blame him. I had helped create this mess. Later that evening, we were all gathered at the dinner table, the conversation light, almost too light. Maurice was telling stories about his days in Hollywood, and Tosin, with a forced smile, nodded along. I tried to focus on my food, to pretend like everything was okay. But inside, I was screaming. Maurice excused himself to take a call, and Tosin stood up quickly, walking toward me. I could feel the energy shift the moment he was near. He leaned down, his voice barely a whisper, it doesn't have to end, Sandra. The Caliph, we can be together. My heart skipped a bit, my hands shaking as I put down my fork. I looked around, making sure no one was watching, but it didn't matter. It was just me and Tosin in that moment. The world outside ceased to exist. Don't do this, I whispered back, my voice breaking. We can't. Your father is my husband. This, this is wrong. He stepped back, but his gaze never left me. I know. But I can't stop what's inside me. You're the only one who can make it stop, Sandra. I felt trapped. Trapped in a situation I had let slip through my fingers. The feeling of betrayal sat heavy in my chest, but it wasn't just betrayal of Maurice. It was betrayal of myself, too. I had let it go too far, let myself get lost in the passion, the temptation, the forbidden. Tosin turned and left the room abruptly, leaving me with nothing but the deafening silence that followed. I sat there, staring at the table, my mind running in circles. Was this the price I had to pay for my choices? A man I could never have, a life I couldn't reclaim. That night, after Tosin had gone to his room, I couldn't sleep. I needed to fix this, but I didn't know how. I had to confront my own heart, my own weakness. I got up and walked out to the balcony, the cool night air wrapping around me like a blanket. Suddenly, Maurice appeared behind me. Sandra, he said, his voice gentle, like he was trying to pull me out of some distant place. What's wrong? You've been distant lately. Talk to me. I turned to him, my heart heavy with guilt. I opened my mouth to say something, but no words came. What could I say? How could I confess to the mess I'd made? Maurice reached out and held my hand, his eyes filled with concern. Whatever it is, we'll walk through it together. You know I'm always here for you. I wanted to break down and tell him everything about Tosin, about how we had crossed a line that could never be uncrossed. But I knew I couldn't. I had already made my choice. I was already living with the consequences. I had to let it go. I had to let Tosin go. I had to find a way to fix the pieces of myself I had shattered in this dangerous game. I smiled weakly at Maurice, forcing myself to be honest in that moment, even if it wasn't the whole truth. I'm sorry, Maurice. I'm just tired. I think I need some time to think things through. He nodded, not pressing further, and I knew it was the calm before the storm. But for the first time in a long time, I felt like I was taking control of my life again, no matter how broken I had become. The lesson for women. As I sit here now, looking back at everything that has happened, I've realized something important. Life is full of choices, and sometimes we get caught up in the wrong ones. We fall for temptation, for feelings that feel too powerful to ignore. But in the end, it's not the thrill that matters, it's the trust, the loyalty, and the respect we owe ourselves and the people who love us. Women, no matter how strong or independent we are, we must never forget the importance of loving ourselves first. We cannot let ourselves be lost in the chaos of the world or the allow of someone else's affection. Sometimes, the hardest thing is to walk away from what feels good in the moment for the sake of what's truly right in the long run. If you're ever faced with a choice like mine, remember this, no love, no passion, is worth sacrificing your own peace of mind. Walk away from what doesn't serve your true self even if it's painful. You deserve better. And always, always trust your heart, because it knows the way even when everything else seems lost.
